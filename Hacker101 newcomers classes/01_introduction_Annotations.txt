Must Have tools
    Burp Proxy
 - This allow you to watch all HTTP(S) communication. intercept and modify requests. and replay existing requests You will use requests, and replay existing requests 
 - You will use this constantly in both your coursework and exams

    Firefox
 - Firefox allows you to set proxy settings specifically in the browser, rather then settings them system-wide
 - This will be your friend when you're testing, to isolate an application

    Mindset

    Understand the application to know how to break it
    Prioritize High-risk areas
    When assessing an application, find every bit of functionality you can. Once you have a rought list of all of the bits of the application, consider this: If i was an attacker, what would my goal be?
    EX: Maybe i'd want credit card numbers from an ecommerce site: Maybe i'd want to destroy or falsify data in a server monitoring application.

    Prioritization

    Once you have a good picture of what an attacker might want, you can start to rank areas of the application in terms of payoff: if I compromise area X, does that give me low-value information or high-value? 
    What about Y instead? When possible, asking developers the question "what keeps you up at night?‚Äù will often point to areas to check.

    Findings

    For the purposes of this course, you should include the following for each vulnerability:
 - Title -- E.g. "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in profiles"
 - Severity
 - Description -- Brief description of what the vulnerability is 
 - Reproduction Steps -- Brief description of how to reproduce the bug; preferably with a small proof of concept Impact -- What can be done with the vulnerability?
 - VIDEOS Mitigation -- How is it fixed?
 - Affected assets -- Generally a list of affected URLs.

    Severity
This is handled differently just about everywhere, but I recommend basing severity on difficulty of exploitation and potential business impact. The following rankings are what I use:
 - Informational -- Issue has no real impact
 - Low -- The business impact is minimal
 - Medium -- Potential to cause harm to users, but not revealing data
 - High -- Potential to reveal user data or aids in exploitation of other vulnerabilities
 - Critical -- High risk of personal/confidential data exposure, general system compromise, and other severe impacts to the business.
